Page Description: "We are a branding and creative studio that brings together the
  world’s best talent, to solve your challenges. \n\nInstead of in-house and junior
  staff we work with leading planners, strategists, researchers, writers, creatives,
  and producers. Instead of costly offices we run our own co-working studio that our
  freelancers rent. \n\nYou’ll pay for brilliant thinking, not for ping pong tables
  and pot plants."

  working collaboratively with thousands of freelances both remotely and in our co-working
  studio since 2016. We are leading the way in providing a flexible, nimble and scalable

Built by title: Built By Experts
Built by description: Umbrella was founded in 2016 by Tash, Tansy and Tim. We’d spent
  decades slogging away either agency or client side, and knew there had to be a better
  version of the 9-5 life.
