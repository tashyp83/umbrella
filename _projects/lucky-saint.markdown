Lucky Saints broke industry standards to develop a low alcohol lager that had all the taste of exceptional beer, without any of the compromise Their product  was exemplary of a sophisticated, modern brand but it fell down in TOV and wider brand communication. Umbrella came on board to help turn a beautiful product into a beautiful brand, giving them a brave new proposition, personality and imagery, that would attract and retain a cult following as new brands enter the market.
