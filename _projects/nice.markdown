We were tasked with turning wine in a can into a generation defining brand. Flipping the client’s initial strategy on its head, we moved them from an ironic and cliched world, to a much braver one that aligned with our women’s values - feisty, no-nonsense and up for a laugh. The punchy name, tone of voice, pack design & brand extensions are already making waves.
