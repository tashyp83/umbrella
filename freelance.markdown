Page Description: Umbrella is a branding and creative studio built on independent
  talent. We are building relationships with thousands of independent experts across
  the globe, to create bespoke teams for all our clients. It means we bring in the
  briefs, manage all the admin, and oversee the project - so you can spend more time
  doing things you love and less time on the things you don’t.

Join Description: "We’re not interested in building an agency full of bored and overworked
  employees.   We want to build an agency that keeps people freelancing for as long
  as possible so that we can harness all that creative joy into great results for
  our clients. \n\nWe employ a support team to manage every project and keep us operating.
  All our creative teams are sourced from our network of people like you."

How it works title: How it works
How it works:
- Word: Collaborate as a team
  Text: |-
    When you’re part of an umbrella team, you are core to the delivery of the project and a hugely important asset to our client. The clients will get to know you. The team will rely on you. And we will, hopefully, grow very fond of you.

    We’ll never air drop you into the middle of a project, give you menial tasks to deliver, and not remember your name!
- Word: Feel the support of an agency
  Text: We know you can spend more time looking for work and project managing it than
    doing the work. So it’s our job to pull the perfect team together, oversee concepts
    and manage everything through to delivery. All with the aplomb of a traditional
    agency.
- Word: Enjoy your freedom
  Text: "We don’t ask for any commitment to join - just need your details. As soon
    as there’s a perfect brief for you, we’ll get in touch. \n\nWe treat you like
    the adults you are. Work from whenever and wherever you are. As long as you deliver
    great work, on time and show up to checkins and meetings as needed, you could
    be on a boat in the Seychelles for all we care (which was actually the case for
    one lucky sod)."
- Word: Work on different briefs
  Text: We like to pick freelancers because of what they bring to the table, not just
    their background. We’ve had architects work on Whiskey, and Print makers work
    on coffee. It means you might work on clients outside your usual remit and hopefully
    bring unique ideas to the table.
- Word: Bring in extra cash
  Text: "If you’ve got hold of a brief that needs more resource or an agency delivery
    - we can take it on and manage the process from sign off, through to production.
    In return, we give you a 3-5% commission, and you can choose how involved you
    want to be in delivering it (for your normal day rate). \n\nWe also offer a £50
    thank you if you recommend a freelancer for a project and we go on to contract
    them. "

Umbrella Studios Description: "We don’t think working for an agency means you need
  to be chained to an office desk 9-5, and nothing has proven that more appropriately
  that than the events of 2020. \n\nWork can be flexible. Work can be anywhere. \n\nBut
  when we set up umbrella we also recognised that people like having somewhere to
  work from, and other creative people to talk to.\n\nWe set up Umbrella Studios as
  an antidote to fancy and expensive co-working spaces. A friendly, cheap and informal
  place our freelancers can hang, rent a desk when they want to, and be part of a
  bigger agency atmosphere whenever they like."
